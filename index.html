      <h3>Web development & design</h3>
      <p class="skill-description">Web development involves in developing a website for the Internet.Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web-based applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which web development commonly refers, may include web engineering, web design, web content development, client-side/server-side scripting, web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.</p>

      <h3>Machine learning & AI</h3>
      <p class="skill-description">Machine learning is a form of AI that enables a system to learn from data rather than through explicit programming. However, machine learning is not a simple process. As the algorithms ingest training data, it is then possible to produce more precise models based on that data. A machine-learning model is the output generated when you train your machine-learning algorithm with data. After training, when you provide a model with an input, you will be given an output.</p>

      <h3>Android development & design</h3>
      <p class="skill-description">Android software development is the process by which applications are created for devices running the Android operating system. Android apps can be written using Kotlin, Java, and C++ languages using the Android software development kit (SDK), while using other languages is also possible. All non-JVM languages, such as Go, JavaScript, C, C++ or assembly, need the help of JVM language code, that may be supplied by tools, likely with restricted API support. Some programming languages and tools allow cross-platform app support (i.e. for both Android and iOS).</p>
